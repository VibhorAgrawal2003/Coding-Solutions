# cp-solutions

---

A collection of algorithms and programs I submitted as solutions for various competitive programming questions. This is for educational and progress-tracking purpose. As of now, all solutions are in C++. They were tested using the following command:

```
g++ -std=c++11 -O2 -Wall solution.cpp
```

### My Profile
I have recently started solving competitive programming questions more systematically and have been enjoying it a lot. I mostly use <b>codeforces</b> for the same.

### List of Solutions
These are the various solutions I submitted online on various competitive programming websites. I update this list regularly after I have documented my solutions. This list is also chronological, the solutions listed below are in the order of latest to oldest.

- [Target Practice](https://github.com/VibhorAgrawal2003/cp-solutions/blob/main/targetPractice.cpp)
- [Good Kid](https://github.com/VibhorAgrawal2003/cp-solutions/blob/main/goodKid.cpp)
- [Dalton The Teacher](https://github.com/VibhorAgrawal2003/cp-solutions/blob/main/daltonTheTeacher.cpp)
- [Beautiful Permutations](https://github.com/VibhorAgrawal2003/cp-solutions/blob/main/permutations.cpp)
- [Increasing Array](https://github.com/VibhorAgrawal2003/cp-solutions/blob/main/increasingArr.cpp)
- [Coins](https://github.com/VibhorAgrawal2003/cp-solutions/blob/main/coins.cpp)
- [Ambitious Kid](https://github.com/VibhorAgrawal2003/cp-solutions/blob/main/ambitiousKid.cpp)
- [Repititions in DNA](https://github.com/VibhorAgrawal2003/cp-solutions/blob/main/repititions.cpp)
- [Missing Number](https://github.com/VibhorAgrawal2003/cp-solutions/blob/main/missingNo.cpp)
- [Weird Algorithm](https://github.com/VibhorAgrawal2003/cp-solutions/blob/main/weirdAlgo.cpp)

### Useful Resources
If you're scanning through this repository, chances are that you are interested in competitive programming yourself. If so, I would like to suggest some resources which I have been following myself.

- [Guide to Competitive Programming](https://duoblogger.github.io/assets/pdf/memonvyftw/guide-t-cp.pdf)
<br>A really nice book to start your journey with competitive programming, especially if you are a devoted C++ programmer like myself (not that fond of coffee). It teaches core language features, important DSA concepts as well as optimisation techniques.

- [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/)
<br>The book is only helpful if you solve these problems along with it. Competitive programming is all about solving problems, the more you do, the better you will get at it.

I am planning on expanding this list when I find new resources. However, I will only recommend what I use personally, so there may be better resources out there that I am blissfully unaware of.

Wowza! You have reached the end of the README file. Now I shall go back to solving more problems.
