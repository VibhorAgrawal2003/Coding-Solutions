# Coding Solutions

---

A collection of algorithms and programs I submitted as solutions for various competitive programming questions. This is for educational and progress-tracking purpose. As of now, all solutions are in C++. They were compiled using the following command:

```
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall folder/solution.cpp -o answer
```

### My Profile
I am currently learning some advanced concepts in C++ such as standard templates, structures and iterators. Focusing on getting a better grasp at core concepts and as such my progress in competitive coding is a bit slow as of now. I mainly use Leetcode and Codeforces to solve problems.

### Directories
This repository contains directories for keeping all my codes organized. I provide brief descriptions for each directory to better understand the programs they entail.

- <b>algorithms</b><br>
It contains some essential algorithms useful for solving coding questions.
<br>

- <b>codeforces</b><br>
It contains my solutions for various problems from the codeforces catalogue both in my own time as well as in ranked competitions.
<br>

- <b>cses</b><br>
It contains my solutions for the CSES problem set for practising competitive programming, algorithmic thinking and C++ language features.
<br>

- <b>leetcode</b><br>
It contains my solutions for questions I selectively picked and solved from Leetcode.
